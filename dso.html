  				<p class="lead">I had the opportunity to intern in DSO in my year 1 summer vacation period where I worked in a team under the
            Electronic Systems division, under a project called Accelerating Compute Intensive Signal Processing Algorithms. I worked to convert
            signal processing algorithms that the research team had done in <span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">MATLAB to C++</span>
             to accelerate it since C++ was a compiled language and the
            team needed it to be in C++ to integrate with other modules. Since MATLAB had a lot of precompiled functions from their toolbox, I had
            to research on how the algorithms worked. I also made use of <span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">OpenMP</span>
            to use multithreading to improve the speed.</p>
          <p class="lead">The first MATLAB algorithm is part of a signal detection process and it performs <span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">estimation
            of the noise floor level from the
            input wideband signal data using a moving window</span>. The noise floor level helps to detect the presence of transmitted signal that would
            require further processing.</p>
          <p class="lead">The second program in MATLAB generates signal data through modulation then up-sampling, filtering and down-sampling before interpolating
            and normalising the input data. The digital data undergoes a modulation function of <span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">‘pskmod’ or
              ‘qammod’ in MATLAB</span> which stands
            for ‘Phase Shift Keying (PSK) Modulation’ and ‘Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)’ respectively.
            The digital data is converted to complex number data according to the constellation plot. For filtering,
            I also had to implement the <span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">Rational transfer function</span> for the low pass filter that
            attenuates unwanted frequency content. Lastly, I had to implement
            the interpolate function which returns interpolated values of a 1-D function at specific query points using linear interpolation.</p>
          <p class="lead">My last task was <span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">developing the instrument drivers for communication and control of the PXI
             peripherals</span> which would be used for testing and measurement.
            One of the program was for a digitizer card, to acquire and capture data from the input waveform from a waveform generator.</p>
            <p class="lead">Through this experience, I learnt to be resourceful and independent in the way I approached my challenges. Since most parts of the tasks
              were new and unfamiliar to me as I had no prior knowledge on signal processing or OpenMP, I had to do a lot of reading, researching and watching tutorials online to
              understand what the algorithms were doing and then get a grasp of how I was going to optimise the algorithms through some of the methods that my supervisor suggested I try or what
              I found online.
              It was especially important when I had difficulties and it also pushed me to improve my problem solving skills by using what was available to me to figure out what went wrong.
               I definitely learnt how to code in C++ better and gained a greater understanding of MATLAB code as well. I was also given a chance to learn about the domain of signal
               processing. My supervisor also gave some tips on how to better structure my project’s
               classes or functions such that the program I wrote would be reusable by different data files and more practical to be used to scale up to process more data files. Lastly,
                I learnt some methods on how to accelerate algorithms using different methods like using a more efficient self-implemented sorting method than the generic sort from the C++
                standard library, exploring other methods available in the different standard libraries and multithreading using what was found in the OpenMP API.
