							<h3 class="font-weight-light" style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:-20px;"><span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">Kong Hwa School, 2006-2011</span></h3>
							<p class="lead">In Kong Hwa School, they nurtured students'
							appreciation of Chinese culture from a young age. I was exposed to Chinese calligrpahy and painting, Chinese musical instruments as well as Chinese
							tea art. We were also given opportunities to learn beyond our syllabus with subjects like
							English literature through books like Charlotte's Web and Lord of the Flies.</p>
							<h3 class="font-weight-light" style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:-20px;"><span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">Chung Cheng High School (Main), 2012-2015</span></h3>
							<p class="lead">Chung Cheng High School (CCHMS) gave me a very enriching experience. I was further
              exposed to Chinese culture as CCHMS was the centre of excellence
							for Chinese Culture in the East Zone. I learnt more Chinese calligraphy with bi-weekly
							lessons, as well as a subject called 'Appreciation of Chinese Culture' which consisted of
							bi-weekly lessons where we learnt about ancient Chinese folklore, Chinese tea art as well as
							some Chinese history. We were also exposed to the Malay Language as part of our curriculum.
							I was part of the Art Club in CCHMS because of my interests in it. There I was given many
							opportunities to try out different art forms like clay sculpture making, street art, watercolour etc.
							We were also encouraged to engage in physical activities
							like camps and were taught Wushu, a Chinese martial art form.</p>
							<h3 class="font-weight-light" style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:-20px;"><span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">Victoria Junior College, 2016-2017</span></h3>
							<p class="lead">My short 2 years in Victoria Junior College (VJC) was incredibly hectic but fulfilling as well.
							I was part of VJC's Interact Club which is under Roteract Club Singapore. We participated in many activies
							and events that contributed back to the community through volunteerism or organising of events. I was given
							the opportunity to be part of the organising committee for 'Community Affair' in VJC which is an annual event
							to get the school community to give back to society. I also volunteered in many events like Walk for Rice by NTUC, a Clothes Drive, a Food drive for Foodbank Singapore, etc.
							I was extremely proud that I was also able to acheive academic excellence and became one of the top scorers
							to acheive 7 A'level distinctions.</p>
							<h3 class="font-weight-light" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom:-20px;"><span class="u--highlight" id="smaller-highlight">National University of Singapore, 2018-present</span></h3>
							<p class="lead">Currently, I am studying in NUS, in the School of Computing. I have been given many opportunities
							to learn about technology through events like AngelHack, BrainHack and through the various modules we take.
							I am also part of Social Impact Catalyst NUS under a project called IlluminateSG where we hope to
							spark conversations on pressing social issues for youths through our events and campaigning. In IlluminateSG,
							I work as the Head of Content Creation for the Marketing team. During my time in NUS, I also interned at
							DSO during my summer in the first year to gain more experience. With the skills I picked up through my Computer Science
              modules, it allowed to me further my self-learning in web and mobile app development during my year 2 summer through my
              own personal projects and online courses.</p>
