				<div style="height: 20px"></div>
				<h3 class="font-weight-light">Kong Hwa School, 2006-2011</h3>
				<p class="lead">I enjoyed my time in Kong Hwa School where they nurtured the 
				appreciation of Chinese culture from a young age so that we would understand our 
				roots as Chinese. I was exposed to Chinese calligrpahy and painting as well as Chinese
				tea art. We were also given opportunities to learn beyond our syllabus such as subjects like 
				English literature through books like Charlotte's Web and Lord of the Flies. Overall, 
				I performed well for my PSLE and was able to enter my desired Secondary school as well.</p>
				<div style="height: 20px"></div>
				
				<h3 class="font-weight-light">Chung Cheng High School (Main), 2012-2015</h3>
				<p class="lead">My time in Chung Cheng High School (CCHMS) was very enriching. Similar to 
				Kong Hwa School, I was further exposed to Chinese culture as CCHMS was the centre of excellence
				for Chinese Culture in the East Zone. There I continued learning Chinese calligraphy with bi-weekly 
				lessons, as well as a subject called 'Appreciation of Chinese Culture' which also consisted of 
				bi-weekly lessons where we learnt about ancient Chinese folklore, Chinese tea art as well as 
				some of Chinese history. We were also exposed to the Malay Language as part of our curriculum.
				I was part of the Art Club in CCHMS because of my interests in it. There I was given many 
				opportunities to try out different art forms like clay sculture making, street art, watercolour etc.
				Besides ensuring we are culturally educated, we were also encouraged to engage in physical activities
				like camps. Our Secondary 3 Resilience Camp was one of the toughest but fulfilling camps we had where
				we camped in Malaysia in the outdoors. There, we went hiking to a waterfall and engaged in activities like
				absailing and rock-climbing.</p>
				<div style="height: 20px"></div>
				<h3 class="font-weight-light">Victoria Junior College, 2016-2017</h3>
				<p class="lead">My short 2 years in Victoria Junior College (VJC) was incredibly hectic but fulfilling as well.
				I was part of VJC's Interact Club which is under Roteract Club Singapore. We participated in many activies
				and events that contributed back to the community through volunteerism or organising of events. I was given
				the opportunity to be part of the organising committee for 'Community Affair' in VJC which is an annual event
				to get the school community to give back to society. I also volunteered in many events like Walk for Rice by NTUC, a Clothes Drive, a Food drive for Foodbank Singapore, etc.
				Besides, I was extremely proud that I was also able to acheive academic excellence and became one of the students
				to acheive 7 A'level distinctions.</p>
				<div style="height: 20px"></div>
				
				<h3 class="font-weight-light">National University of Singapore, 2018-present</h3>
				<p class="lead">Currently, I am studying in NUS in the School of Computing. I have been given many opportunities
				to learn about technology through events like AngelHack, BrainHack and through the modules we take.
				I am also part of Social Impact Catalyst NUS under a project called IlluminateSG where we hope to 
				spark conversations on pressing social issues for youths through our events and campaigning. In IlluminateSG, 
				I work as the Head of Content Creation for the Marketing team. During my time in NUS, I also interned at
				DSO during my summer in the first year.</p>
